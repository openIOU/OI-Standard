README
========

Put all openPayment standard information in this REPO.  All documentation should go in the WIKI.  Other files should just be dumped into the REPO itself.  If possible please try to keep everything in MD format while creating additional folders as needed.  If we end up creating other source files that need to be built (like examples) we will create another REPO.
  Hello world openPayment is here!
